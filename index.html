        <h2>Critique Feedback:</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no back arrow from the signup screen just in case you click the wrong button on the landing screen.</li>
                <li>Some of the fonts are difficult to read.</li>
                <li>Good contrast color for subscription, but contraction between gold and platinum is not distinct. Gold stands out more than platinum due to the coloring.</li> 
                <li>Hesitant to sign up immediately, so implement free trial, so user is able to see the mechnics of the application before subscribing</li>
                <li>Confusion about the meaning of the checkmarks on the profile page</li>
                <li>The icons in the bottom navigation bar are intuitive for the most part, but text would help for some people who don't understand.</li>
            </ul>
